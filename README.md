<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
Freshman, transfer, and even current students often don't know where a specific building or room is located on campus and/or how to get there. 



<b>Map Feature</b><br>
The Map Feature provides directions from their current location to a specific building or room on campus. This allows the user to drop the freshman status of carrying around oversized map in public. This <em>eco-friendly</em> option saves mountains of paper and ink while providing the user with an innovative and accurate solution to campus transport. Worry less about arriving late to a scheduled class or a teacher's office hours because you’re unsure of where it’s located.

<b>Individual Itinerary Feature</b><br>
The Individual Itinerary or school scheduler eliminates the guess work in meeting with friends or classmates. Whether you’re trying to find free time to go to the gym, get lunch, or schedule a time to meet for a class project with a group of individuals, the cross referencing tool will allow for hassle free scheduling. For the first time, this shows corresponding free time of your selected friend group in regards to your individual schedule.
